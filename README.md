# mosquito-movement-spatial-repellent-method
method for secondary analysis of trial data

# r codes _ simulation

contains the r codes for simulating the trial scenarios (with/out seasonality data)
the parameter values and file names for the simulations can be edited at the end of each r script

these models can simulate datasets with different parameter combination files

# cpp codes _ simulation

contains the cpp codes to run the simulations (separate files for code with/out seasonality)

each input dataset from the r simulations has to be renamed to "aggTrapSimul.txt" for the code to run

Otherwise,
batch scripts make this process easier by automating the process for all the simulated datasets
